# Motivation

This `.Rmd` file is based on the **excellent** advice in the paper, ["Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/) by Wilson et al. This file can be knitted to create a `README.md` file, too. 

## The CITATION, requirements.txt, and LICENSE files

- The `CITATION` and `LICENSE` files are created below. This function also creates a `requirements.txt` file that should list all dependencies for this project. 

```{r goodenuff_collab}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_collab()
```

See the Appendix below for the contents in these files. 

## The code folder

This folder is titled `src` in the paper, but I opted for the more descriptive term `code`. 

```{r goodenuff_code}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_code() 
```

`code` can mean a lot of different things, so I will reprint the section of the paper here: 

> ***Put project source code in the src directory. (4d)** `src` contains all of the code written for the project. This includes programs written in interpreted languages such as R or Python; those written compiled languages like Fortran, C++, or Java; as well as shell scripts, snippets of SQL used to pull information from databases; and other code needed to regenerate the results.

### The Scientific Guts

The code below creates the following scripts based on the `tidyverse` workflow in the `code` folder. 

These are the `import`, `wrangle`, `visualize`, `model`, and `communicate` scripts created below. 

```
code/
    ├── 01-import.R
    ├── 02-tidy.R
    ├── 03-wrangle.R
    ├── 04-visualize.R
    ├── 05-model.R
    ├── 06-communicate.R
    └── runall.R
```


> This directory may contain two conceptually distinct types of files that should be distinguished either by clear file names or by additional sub-directories. The first type are files or groups of files that perform the core analysis of the research, such as data cleaning or statistical analyses. These files can be thought of as the "scientific guts" of the project.

### Script headers

```r
#=====================================================================#
# This is code to create:
# Authored by and feedback to:
# MIT License
# Version:
#=====================================================================#
```

> The second type of file in `src` is controller or driver scripts that that contains all the analysis steps for the entire project from start to finish, with particular parameters and data input/output commands. A controller script for a simple project, for example, may read a raw data table, import and apply several cleanup and analysis functions from the other files in this directory, and create and save a numeric result. For a small project with one main output, a single controller script should be placed in the main src directory and distinguished clearly by a name such as "`runall`". The short example in Figure [fig:script] is typical of scripts of this kind; note how it uses one variable, TEMP_DIR, to avoid repeating the name of a particular directory four times.

The controller script is created in the code folder as, `runall.R`.

Below is a header for the `runall.R` script.

```r
#=====================================================================#

# The controller script: A controller script for a simple project, for example,
# may read a raw data table, import and apply several cleanup and analysis
# functions from the other files in this directory, and create and save a
# numeric result.

# TEMP_DIR = ./temp_zip_files/

# echo 'Packaging zip files required by analysis tool...'
# mkdir $(TEMP_DIR)
# ./src/make-zip-files.py $(TEMP_DIR) *.dat

# echo 'Analyzing...'
# ./bin/sqr_mean_analyze -i $(TEMP_DIR) -b 'temp'

# echo 'Cleaning up...'
# rm -rf $(TEMP_DIR)

#=====================================================================#
```

## The data folder

```{r goodenuff_data}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_data() 
```

This folder will store your data. The data are arguably the most important part to an analysis, so I've included two articles that are absolute necessities to good data management. 

1. [How to Share Data for Collaboration](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375987) by Shannon E. Ellis & Jeffrey T. Leek

2. [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) by Karl W. Broman & Kara H. Woo

These two are included in the `README.md` file in the data folder

```
data/
    ├── README.md
    └── raw
```

- The data folder also has a `raw` sub-folder.

## The doc folder

```{r goodenuff_doc}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_doc() 
```

> The `doc` directory contains two text files written in Markdown, one containing a running lab notebook describing various ideas for the project and how these were implemented and the other containing a running draft of a manuscript describing the project findings.

### The CHANGELOG.txt

The `CHANGELOG.md` file is for documenting "*dated notes about changes to the project in this file in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent first). This file is the equivalent of a lab notebook, and should contain entries like those shown below.* This can also referred to as the `NEWS.md` file. 

```
...make dated notes about changes to the project in this file in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent first). This file is the equivalent of a lab notebook, and should contain entries like those shown below.

## 2016-04-08

* Switched to cubic interpolation as default.

* Moved question about family's TB history to end of questionnaire.

## 2016-04-06

* Added option for cubic interpolation.

* Removed question about staph exposure (can be inferred from blood test results).
```

### The manuscript.md

Draft of your manuscript.

```
# Manuscript

...a running draft of a manuscript describing the project findings
```

### The notebook.md

For your brilliant ideas

```
# Notebook

...a running lab notebook describing various ideas for the project and how these were implemented


```


## The results folder

```{r goodenuff_results}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_results() 
```

These are visualizations, model outputs, etc. It has three sub-folders:

```
results
    ├── figures
    ├── manuscript
    └── tables
```

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.
